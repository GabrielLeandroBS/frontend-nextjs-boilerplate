Template is a modern web application developed with Next.js, designed to be a starting point for your next project. The project uses the latest technologies from the React and Next.js ecosystem to provide an exceptional development experience. This template includes features like authentication, internationalization, dark mode, and a component library, making it perfect for building modern web applications.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
NODE_ENV=development
```

4. Run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

5. For production build

```bash
pnpm build
```

6. To start in production

```bash
pnpm start
```

## 🌐 Internationalization

The project uses i18next for complete multi-language support. Translations are managed through JSON files located in `src/locales/`.

## 🎨 UI/UX

- Custom design system based on Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI
- Reusable and accessible components from Shadcn/UI library
- Light/dark theme support with next-themes
- Smooth and responsive animations with tw-animate-css
- Responsive layout for all devices
- Consistent design language across the application
- High-quality, accessible UI components
- Modern and clean interface design

## 🔒 Authentication

- Robust authentication system with NextAuth.js
- Support for multiple authentication providers
- Secure session management
- Route protection
- Middleware-based authentication flow

## 📦 Project Structure

```
src/
├── app/              # Next.js pages and layouts
├── components/       # Reusable components
├── hooks/           # Custom hooks
├── lib/             # Utilities and configurations
├── locales/         # Translation files
├── services/        # Services and APIs
├── styles/          # Global styles
├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
└── middleware.ts    # Authentication and i18n middleware
```

### Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)

The middleware handles:

- 🔒 Route protection for authenticated routes
- 🔄 Authentication redirects
- 🌐 Internationalization routing
- 🎯 Public route access

Key features:

- Protects `/dashboard/*` routes
- Redirects authenticated users from auth pages
- Redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in
- Handles locale detection and routing
- Supports multiple languages (pt, en)

### 🔧 Component Interfaces

For custom components that don't depend on Shadcn/UI updates, it's necessary to create specific interfaces:

```
src/
├── models/
│   ├── interfaces/
│   │   ├── component-name.ts  # Interface for the component
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
```

Example of interface structure:

```typescript
// src/models/interfaces/component-name.ts
import { ReactNode } from "react";

export interface ComponentNameProps {
  children?: ReactNode;
  className?: string;
  // Other component-specific props
}
```

Benefits of this approach:

- Clear separation between Shadcn/UI components and custom components
- Better maintainability and scalability
- Facilitates documentation and code understanding
- Allows independent evolution of custom components
